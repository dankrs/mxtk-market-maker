# AMM Bot Details

## Objective

Develop an automated market-making (AMM) bot that simulates natural coin swapping activity between USDT and MXTK on Uniswap V3. The bot will create three wallets, execute randomized trades, and maintain a balance between buying and selling.

---

## Requirements

- **Blockchain Networks:** Ethereum & Arbitrum  
- **Smart Contract Language:** Solidity  
- **Bot Logic Language:** JavaScript (Node.js)  
- **AMM Protocol:** Uniswap V3  
- **Swappable Assets:** USDT, MXTK  
- **Wallet Management:** Create and manage three separate wallets  
- **IMPORTANT - Trade Execution:**  
  - The bot **always** initiates with a USDT → MXTK swap  
  - Subsequent swaps can be **either direction (USDT → MXTK or MXTK → USDT)**  
  - Randomized trade amounts and frequency to mimic organic activity  

---

## Technical Details

### 1. Wallet Creation and Management

- The bot should generate **three Ethereum/Arbitrum wallets** dynamically.
- Store private keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or encrypted storage).
- Ensure each wallet has sufficient ETH for gas fees.

### 2. Integration with Uniswap V3

- Fetch the **current pool price** for USDT/MXTK on Uniswap V3.
- Use Uniswap’s **swapExactTokensForTokens** function.
- Ensure **proper slippage tolerance** to prevent failed transactions.
- Implement logic for **fee tier selection** based on market conditions.

### 3. Trade Execution Strategy

- **IMPORTANT - First trade:** Always swap USDT → MXTK !!!
- **Subsequent trades:** Randomly decide between:
  - MXTK → USDT  
  - USDT → MXTK  
- **Randomized elements:**
  - **Trade size:** Within a specified range (0.01 USDT - 1 USDT)
  - **Trade timing:** Random delays between trades (10s - 2min)

### 4. Transaction Monitoring

- Use WebSockets or event listeners to track **successful swaps**.
- Implement **error handling** for failed transactions (e.g., insufficient liquidity, slippage errors).
- Retry logic for **stuck transactions**.

### 5. Security Considerations

- **Private Key Management:** Use environment variables or a secure vault.

- **Gas Optimization:** Monitor gas fees and execute trades during optimal fee periods.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Solidity Smart Contract (if needed)**
   - If custom contract logic is required for batching transactions or optimizing execution.

2. **Node.js Bot Implementation**
   - Web3.js or Ethers.js integration.
   - Automated wallet creation and management.
   - Trade execution logic (buy/sell cycle with randomization).
   - Monitoring and logging system for executed trades.

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Use **Hardhat or Foundry** for smart contract testing.
   - Mock Uniswap V3 interactions for local testing.

---

## Success Criteria

- The bot successfully swaps USDT → MXTK on first execution.
- Randomized trade execution to mimic organic trading behavior.
- Properly handles slippage, fees, and error conditions.
- Works seamlessly across Ethereum and Arbitrum networks.
